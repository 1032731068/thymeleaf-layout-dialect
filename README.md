Thymeleaf Layout Dialect
========================

A new dialect for Thymeleaf that allows you to use layout/decorator pages to
style your content.  If you've ever used SiteMesh 2, then the concepts of this
library will be very familiar to you.


Requirements
------------

 - Java 6
 - Thymeleaf 2.0 (2.0.8 and its dependencies included)


Usage
-----

Create a page that will contain a layout that will be shared between pages.
Often this will be a template that contains a page header, navigation, a footer,
and a spot where your page content will go.

(more to come...)
